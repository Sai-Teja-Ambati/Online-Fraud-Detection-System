### Online-Fraud-Detection-System
Developed an online fraud detection system using the PaySim dataset. The project includes EDA, data preprocessing, PCA, feature selection, and classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree). The Decision Tree emerged as the best model. Also implemented a voting ensemble classifier to improve prediction accuracy.

This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for detecting online fraud, utilizing the PaySim dataset. The project includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction with PCA, feature selection, and individual classification models. The decision tree classifier emerged as the best-performing model for the balanced PaySim dataset.

## Project Overview

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of data distributions
- Correlation analysis

### Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Data normalization and transformation

### Dimensionality Reduction
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce feature space

### Feature Selection
- Identifying significant features for model training

### Classification Models
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Model performance evaluated using classification reports

### Voting Ensemble Classifier
- Combining individual models to enhance prediction accuracy

## Results

The Decision Tree classifier demonstrated superior performance on the balanced PaySim dataset, making it the best model for this fraud detection system.
